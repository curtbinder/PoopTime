    <string name="info">This app is designed to help those people who have difficulty pooping.\n\n
It\'s quick and simple to track when you poop. You can easily view your poop history.
From the Main page, you can easily log a poop "Now" or from another time (\"Other\").
You can classify the type of poop and make a note about your poop.\n\n
You can choose "History" or "Calendar" from the options menu to view the respective page.\n\n
History - Shows a list of all the poops. If you long-press on the poop, you can edit it.\n\n
Calendar - Shows a calendar of all the poops. A brown highlighted day indicates a poop was on that day.
A Circle highlighted day is the current day and it\'s brown if there\'s a poop on the day.
